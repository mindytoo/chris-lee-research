                    <small>Why have drones perch?</small>
                </h2>
                <p>Drones are massively useful tools in exploration and information gathering in otherwise difficult, dangerous, or costly to reach areas via manned aircraft. Thus as the applications of drones broaden, the variety of terrain they should be able to safely perch on increases. These new landing gear designs enable the vehicles to "perch‚Äù on contrary platforms such as branches and wires in addition to planar surfaces while using gravity to maintain stability.</p>

                <h2 class="page-header">The First Design
                    <small>Using Gravity for Actuation.</small>
                </h2>
                <p>Inspired by the biomechanics of sleeping birds, this design utilizes the weight of the drone to collapse a four bar linkage with a cable running around three of the four joints and to the ends of four grasping digits. As the four bar collapses, it enlongates, causes the cable to be pulled in with the tips of the grapsing digits. The more the drone weighs, the tighter and more stable the grasp is.</p>
                <p>The drone used is the <a href = "http://www.dji.com/product/flame-wheel-arf">DJI FlameWheel F550</a>, a UAV featuring 6 motors and a 5.5 meter diagonal wheelbase. When fully outfitted with electronics and motors, the drone weighs approximately 5 lbs. A three cell battery was used as a payload to simulate the weight of the electronics and motors on the chassis.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>A jamming mechanism in the extended configuration of the four-bar directs the force vectors during landing to efficiently collapse the linkage. Fishing line was used as cabling due to its flexibility and lack of friction. These decreased resistances allow for the weight of the hexacoptor to collapse and keep collapsed the linkage. Segmented 3D printed pulleys are located at each joint and guide the cables around the four-bar. Since the cable runs around the horizontal pulleys on the four-bar twice, the four-bar's travel distance upon collapse is less than the true travel distance required to actuate the gripping digits. </p>
                <table>
                <td><img src="img\plg\locking.jpg" alt="Leg Locking Mechanism" style="width:90%"></td>
                <td><p>A servo on each leg of the landing gear controls a 3D printed lock, seen left, that jams the landing gear when fully collapsed. The lock ensures that environmental disturbances will not cause the drone to tip off its perch and unintentionally loosen its grip. The lock is made out of ABS plastic and <a href = "http://www.ninjaflex3d.com/">NinjaFlex</a>. The NinjaFlex acts as a spring that keeps the mechanism in a default ``locked'' position (left). When the servos attached to the top four-bar segment are told to release, they pull on a stiff wire, lifting the hook out of the bottom four-bar segment (right).</p></td>
                </table>
                <br>
                <p>Inspired by Justin Thomas et. al and their work on a quick grasp mechanism based on the biomechanics of predatory birds, a servo motor was introduced between the chassis of the drone and the four-bar perching landing gear. The servo motor enables the drone to approach perches at a angle, eliminating the need for traditional vertical take-off and landing (VTOL). Controlling the angle between the perching landing gear and the drone chassis also enables the introduction of a gyroscope and a control mechanism for aligning the drone's (effectively an inverted pendulum) and the landing gear's centers of mass. </p>

                <p>The two four-bars are attached to a hexagonal axle which is mounted to a housing for the servo motor using bearings. A gear on the axle meshes with a servo controlled gear. The servo motor housing is then mounted to the bottom of the FlameWheel using 3D printed standoffs with threaded inserts.</p>

                <p>Another jamming mechanism is implemented to prevent the angle between the drone chassis and the landing gear from changing after the four-bars fully collapse. A clamp lined in polyester/vinyl foam mesh is pulled against the axle by cables running along the top three pulleys of each four-bar. The friction hold allows for a jamming mechanism that does not have discrete points like those of a pin.</p>

                    <small>Designing Underacted Grasping.</small>
                </h3>
                <p>The legs are equipped with four identical gripping digits that are 3D printed with ABS plastic filament comprising the rigid portions and NinjaFlex flexible plastic filament comprising the spring spine. As the four-bar collapses and the cable pulls, the segments close to form a grip around the object. In order to prevent the segments at the digit tips from curling before grasping the target perch, modifications were made to actuate the segments closest to the base of the landing gear before the latter segments. The task is accomplished through two ways: a gradient of NinjaFlex along the digits and varying the height of each segment. By having the NinjaFlex thinned out near the base of the landing gear allows those segments to actuate first with less resistance. Making the digits higher close to the base of the landing gear increases the distance between the pivoting NinjaFlex and the fishing line which applies the force, effectively increasing the torque and making the pull more effective.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>To further improve the effectiveness of grip, the bottom facing surfaces of the palm and fingers are outfitted with a pad of polyester/vinyl <a href = "http://www.mcmaster.com/#85695k1/=yfo977">foam mesh</a>. This is a RoHS compliant material that is water, bacteria, and flame resistant and used commonly to increase friction between surfaces for resisting motion. Additionally, the angles between the segments were decreased to increase the surface area of the bottom facing surfaces while maintaining their geometry. This boasts greater contact points.</p>

                    <small>In this Age of Minis.</small>
                </h3>
                <p>Advancement in technology allows batteries and electronics to decrease in size and weight, enabling the miniaturization of UAVs. These smaller UAVs are often more discrete, maneuverable, and cost-effective than their larger counterparts. The greatest limitation in  outfitting these smaller drones with appropriate landing gear is the weight load constraint of the UAV. The Flamewheel F550 has a maximum takeoff weight of 1200-2400g.  500g is taken up by the weight of the frame, so its maximum payload is 700-1900g. The <a href = "http://dromida.com/air/dide01xx-ominus/index.html">Dromida Ominus</a>, a 100 gram 4 rotor recreational UAV with a 238 mm diagonal span, can only take off with 60g of extra weight beyond its frame, based on experiments. Due to these load bearing restrictions, the landing gear must be able to be scaled to be applicable universally. The design decisions made for the miniature four-bar landing gear were primarily to decrease the size and weight of the landing gear.</p>
                <p>To decrease the weight for the miniaturized landing gear, the legs of the linkage were shortened to approximately 1 inch long, and leg is comprised of a single fourbar.  Additionally, rather than making two individually actuated legs, a single, wide leg with two separated feet was used.</p>

                    <small>Using Hooks to Perch.</small>
                </h2>
                <p>The abundance of telephone wires in the average American urban environment provides the possibility of creating a landing gear that allows the drone to hang on a cable and take off. Previous landing gear was developed by Joseph L. Moore for fixed wing drones to perch and possibly charge on powerline cables.</p>
                <p>Using the <a href = "http://store.makerbot.com/replicator2x">MakerBot 2X</a>, the hook design is 3D printed using ABS and NinjaFlex filaments. The design incorporates a curved upper part to let the wire be inclined to slip into the hooked part in the situation where the drone slightly misses the wire. A T-spline is created to provide more structural support to the hook. Due to the simplicity of the design and the low cost of manufacturing, the hook is easily scalable and applicable to drones of various sizes.</p>
